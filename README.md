# MySQL-Frontend-GUI for Linux
A simple down-to-earth GUI frontend developed in Python3 for simple admin tasks on MySQL-Server running on the localhost. Developed for my CS School Project.

# What's different
This branch now has its GUI optimised for Linux systems using the fonts provided by MS.
Other than that, there's hardly any difference.

# System Requirements:
This program should run on your Windows computer with Python3, MySQL Server, and the below-mentioned Python Libraries installed in the virtual environment.

# Installation Pre-requisites
1. The Following Python Libraries are required to execute the program:
    1. pyqt5
    2. pyqt5-tools
    3. mysql-connector
       \
These libraries are available in the project's (.venv) virtual environment.

2. MySQL/MariaDB-Server from v5.1 and above, active and running.

# Installation and Running

1. Download the entire repo contents as a .zip and extract it in a folder on your computer.
2. Enable the venv by running the appropriate shell script fount in `./.venv/bin/<activate_shell_script>`
3. Execute the python file MySQL-Frontend_v2.0XX.py on your Python shell.
4. Pls do not move around any .png or .ui file into other directories otherwise the python script may not run well.
5. You are done.
